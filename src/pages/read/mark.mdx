Never write a single line of HTML again! Mark is easy-to-read and easy-to-write--perfect for quickly writing static websites.

Here is a screenshot of the [source code](https://github.com/kocaviation/kocaviation.github.io)

<img src="/readassets/mark_kocaviation.webp" draggable="false" />

Look at that syntactic sugar!
